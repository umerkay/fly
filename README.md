# Simple Flight Simulator

Welcome to the **Simple Flight Simulator**! This project is a lightweight, browser-based flight simulation experience designed to provide users with an interactive and engaging way to explore basic flight mechanics.

## Features

- **Map Selector**: Choose from different environments such as Desert, Hills, Mountains, and Snow Field.
- **Thrust Control**: Adjust thrust using the on-screen thrust bar or keyboard controls.
- **Interactive Gauges**:
  - **Speedometer**: Displays the current speed in mph.
  - **Compass**: Shows the current heading direction.
  - **Attitude Indicator**: Visualizes pitch and roll angles.
  - **Altimeter**: Displays altitude and vertical speed.
- **Night Mode**: Toggle night mode for a darker interface.
- **Engine Control**: Turn the engine off or on.
- **Parking Brakes**: Engage or disengage parking brakes.
- **Pause Functionality**: Pause the simulation at any time.
- **Loading Screen**: Displays a loading screen before the simulation starts.
- **Restart Button**: Restart the simulation from the beginning.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Simulation**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
   - On the welcome screen, select a map from the dropdown menu and click the "Start" button.

2. **Control the Aircraft**:
   - Use the thrust bar or keyboard controls (`W` to increase thrust) to take off.
   - Monitor the gauges to maintain control of the aircraft:
     - Speedometer for speed.
     - Compass for heading.
     - Attitude Indicator for pitch and roll.
     - Altimeter for altitude and vertical speed.

3. **Additional Controls**:
   - Use the buttons in the control panel to toggle night mode, turn off the engine, engage parking brakes, or pause the simulation.

4. **Restart**:
   - Click the "Restart" button to reset the simulation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and simulation logic.
- **Three.js**: For rendering 3D environments and objects.
- **Noise.js**: For procedural noise generation.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the simulator.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the simulator's UI.
- `index.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for the simulation.
- External Libraries:
